#Basics Overview
This section will introduce students to the basics of go. You will be able to make single package systems that can perform basic calculations and logical tasks.

##Where to next?

If you have completed all the lessons in the basics section, you should have a good understanding of basic Go functionality, and you will be able to create programs that work for you. You could stop here and feel satisfied with the ability to write basic programs in Go, but a much better option is to move on to the intermediate section of this course and learn some in depth programming skills that allow you to make and understand more complex programs.
