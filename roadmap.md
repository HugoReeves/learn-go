#The Learn Go Roadmap

The following are the plans for the Learn Go resource. You can see more than just the planned core lessons by checking out the [Projects](https://github.com/DevelopDevs/learn-go/projects) section. If you would like to see the current lessons that have been completed, visit the [Course Outline](https://github.com/DevelopDevs/learn-go#course-outline)

##Plans for the Core lessons
Core lessons include the basics, intermediate and advanced categories. These are aimed to teach the Go language to visitors. The basics section teaches the fundamentals such as for loops and basic if else logic. The intermediate section teaches visitors about the scope, pointers and other topics, giving them a better understanding of how Go works and giving them more control in their programs. The advanced section teaches visitors the most complex parts of Go and is the final step in learning how to fully utilise the Go programming language.

The lessons here may be complete or incomplete. The complete lessons will be linked to.
