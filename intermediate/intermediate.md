#Intermediate Section Overview

Now that we know the basics of programming in Go, we can move on to more advanced topics that will give you greater control over your code and allow you to complete more complex tasks. In this section we will learn about various intermediate topics including pointers, structs and methods.

##Lessons

1. [Advanced Functions](adv-func/adv-func.md) - Learn how to create functions that return more than one value, and take an arbitrary number of arguments.
1. [Recursive Functions](recursive-functions/recursive-functions.md) - Recursive Functions are functions that call themselves.
1. [Anonymous Functions and Closures](anonymous-functions-closures/anonymous-functions-closures.md) - Anonymous Functions allow us to make and use functions inline and Anonymous Functions can create closures.
